  "readme": "# karma-fixtures-preprocessor\n\nReads the content of your fixture files and constructs a global array, `__FIXTURES__`, that contains the content of those files.\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install karma-fixtures-preprocessor --save`\n\n**Note:** Karma will automatically see and include plugins whose names start with `karma-*`. However, it is possible that, in your IDE or console configurations, you're running Karma as a global Node module. In that case, you'll have to install this plugin too globally, i.e `npm install karma-fixtures-preprocessor -g`.\n\n## Configuration\n\n```js\n// karma.conf.js\nmodule.exports = function(config) {\n  config.set({\n    files: [\n      'test/fixtures/**/*.json' // The location of your fixture files in relation to this, karma.conf.js, file.\n    ],\n\n    preprocessors: {\n      'test/fixtures/**/*.json': ['fixtures'] // Again, the location of your fixture files in relation to this, karma.conf.js, file.\n    },\n  })\n}\n```\n\nThat's all. This plugin doesn't provide any other configurable options.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThe plugin will read the content of each of your fixture files and push its content, as-is, to a global array called `__FIXTURES__`. Because the content is pushed into the array as-is, you have to make sure that whatever is in your fixture files is valid JavaScript value.\n\nWe use this plugin in our own AngularJS project at AppAdvice to construct the `__FIXTURES__` array from multiple JSON files. Then in the `specHelper.js` of our Jasmine tests, we do:\n \n```js\nangular.forEach(__FIXTURES__, function(fixture) {\n  $httpBackend['when' + fixture.httpVerb](fixture.url).respond(fixture.response)\n})\n```\n\n## LICENSE\nMIT - Copyright (C) AppAdvice.",
